## About Me

I studied at UC Santa Barbara and graduated with a B.A. in Geography / GIS. My passion for data analytics and visualization has led me to pursue a career in data analytics. I specialize in using SQL and Excel for data manipulation and analysis and am actively searching for a data analytics job where I may apply these skills to contribute to meaningful projects.

I also showcase my data visualizations on Tableau. Visit my Tableau Public profile to view interactive visualizations and dashboards:
